  * 2nd: View All Inquiries (Admin/Staff only)
  * 3rd: Reports / Downloads / Stats (optional future)

### 🔹 **2. New Inquiry Flow (Main Feature)**

#### Step 1: Inquiry Form (Initial Page)

| Field             | Type                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Student Name      | Text                        |
| Course            | Dropdown (dynamic)          |
| Contact No        | Text/Phone                  |
| Address           | Text                        |
| Father Contact No | Text/Phone                  |
| Action            | Dropdown: Confirm / Pending |
| Submit Button     | On submit, check dropdown   |

#### 🧠 Logic:

* If **Pending** → Save all fields to `inquiries` table in DB with status `"pending"`
* If **Confirm** → Redirect to Enrollment Form (Step 2)
